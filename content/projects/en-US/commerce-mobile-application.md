The objective was to launch a robust mobile commerce app under tight delivery constraints.

I handled architecture decisions and implementation details across frontend, backend integration, and notifications.

## Key decisions

- Structured screens and navigation for clear conversion paths.
- Added instrumentation to monitor user behavior and retention.
- Ensured the API contract was resilient against partial failures.
