I built this website to own my professional narrative and show real engineering work in one place.

Instead of relying only on social profiles, I wanted a fast and multilingual platform where I can publish project details, technical writing, and resume updates with full control over structure and SEO.

## What I built

- Locale-aware routing with automatic language detection.
- Markdown content pipeline for projects and blog posts with validated frontmatter.
- SEO and distribution endpoints, including sitemap, robots, and RSS/Atom/JSON feeds.
- Resume page and direct PDF delivery aligned with each supported locale.
