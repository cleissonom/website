This project focused on reliability and speed for a mobile-first product.

The architecture used event-driven processing and cloud-native services on AWS to keep latency low while handling spikes in photo uploads.

## What I delivered

- Designed backend APIs for upload, moderation, and profile verification.
- Introduced observability and failure recovery paths for processing jobs.
- Improved recommendation quality by integrating graph-based user relationships.
